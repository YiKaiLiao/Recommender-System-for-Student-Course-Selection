conclusion: 
	1. comparison of rmse between ppca, knn course, and knn student
	--> randomly discard 20% data: knn course < ppca < knn student  (ppca and knn course results are close)
		(why does knn course outperform knn student??)
		--> explanation: data isn't gaussian
			--> merging students' score:
				gaussian: normalization, non-gaussian: PR ranking&equation

	2. senior year score prediction
	--> rmse: knn course < ppca < knn student

	3. PCA on students' scores
	--> k=3 50% explained, k=20 90% explained
	--> map core courses to each pc axes?
